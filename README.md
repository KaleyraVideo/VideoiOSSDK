## Installation

Several installation methods are supported. [CocoaPods][cocoapods] and [Swift package manager][spm] are the most straightforward way to add the SDK to your project. If you're new to CocoaPods, their website contains lots of helpful [documentation][cocoapods-getting-started]. [Carthage][carthage] is also supported, for futher information head over to our [installation guide][installation-guide].
Even though the SDK has changed name from **Bandyer** to **Kaleyra Video** the SDK module name is still named **Bandyer**.

### SPM

Starting from 3.7.0 version the SDK supports Swift package manager. 
In order to add the package to your app, select add package in Xcode and use this repository URL from the Xcode user interface

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods][cocoapods] is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate the SDK into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<YOUR_TARGET_NAME>' do
    pod 'Bandyer'
end
```

Replace '\<YOUR\_TARGET\_NAME\>' with the name of your App target and then, in the Podfile directory, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install --repo-update
```
